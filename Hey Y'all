My name is Kristi Meyers (she/her)
My major is like my life often confusing and undecided. I'm currently deciding between Business Adminstration and applying into the Surgical Tech program at the end of 2023.
My current occupation is Problem Solver at DET3 Amazon Fufillment Center. I work 3 12 hour shifts. Thurs-Sat. It sucks but it pays the bills.
I hope to get a better grade out of this class to lift my GPA.
Something I would like for you to know,
